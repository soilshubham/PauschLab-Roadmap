**Some Useful Advice:** Try to explore all the options available to you as I've told before UI/UX alone wont take you further. For example if you think you are good at math try to learn Machine Learning [Here's the Roadmap of McCarthy Lab](https://github.com/NextTechLabAP/McCarthy-Lab-Roadmap)

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you upload all your work to github. Github is a must for the lab.
#### Learn Github
- [Git](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/) - Introduction
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Software
